# HeimShell (CVE-2023-51803)

**HeimShell** is an exploit for CVE-2023-51803, leveraging an arbitrary file-upload vulnerability in LinuxServer.io Heimdall (≤ 2.5.6). It will auto-detect the target version and either  warn of exploitability or remote fetch a php shell defined by `SHELL_URL` 

- **≤ 2.2.2**: Aribtrary file upload is possible but files are served statically and no URLs are not remotely fetched
- **≥ 2.2.3 & ≤ 2.5.6**: remote-fetch PHP shell via icon URL upload  


---

* **Version Check:** Retrieves `/settings` and parses the Version field to ensure arbitrary upload capability exists.
* **CSRF Token Retrieval:** Loads `/items/create` and scrapes the `hidden _token` input.
* **Shell Deployment:** For versions ≥ 2.2.3, it uses the icon parameter pointing to a remote PHP shell URL on a webserver
* **Item Enumeration:** Scrapes the item list (`/items`) to find the dashboard entry matching the random tag.
* **Shell URL Extraction:** Checks edit page (`/items/<id>/edit`), finds `icon` or `#appimage img` element, and prints shell URL.
